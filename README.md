## Technologies Used

- **[NestJS](https://nestjs.com/):** A powerful Node.js framework that provides a scalable architecture.
- **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/):** A NoSQL database that manages dynamic and high-volume data.
- **[Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/):** An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **[Socket.IO](https://socket.io/):** (Optional) For enabling real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers.

## Project Architecture

ChatHub follows a modular architecture using NestJS. Key modules include:

- **Chat Module:** Manages chat functionalities such as message handling, real-time events, and room management.
- **Database Module:** Handles MongoDB integration and connection using environment variables.
- **Static Assets Module:** Serves the client-side assets from the `public` folder.

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture:

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14.x or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (local instance or remote database)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chathub.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd chathub
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory to store your environment variables. For example:

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/chat-app
PORT=3000
```

This configuration ensures that sensitive data like the database URL is not hard-coded in your source code.

```bash
npm run start:dev
# or
yarn start:dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application in action.

### Production Mode

1. **Build the application:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   ```

2. **Run the production build:**

   ```bash
   npm run start:prod
   # or
   yarn start:prod
   ```

---

## Testing

ChatHub includes unit and integration tests to ensure reliable functionality. To run the tests:

## Deployment

To deploy ChatHub, consider the following steps:

1. **Environment Setup:** Configure your production environment with the required environment variables.
2. **Containerization:** Use Docker to containerize your application for easier deployment.
3. **Cloud Providers:** Deploy on popular cloud platforms like AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean.
4. **Scaling:** Implement load balancing and scaling strategies as your user base grows.

Example Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM node:14
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "run", "start:prod"]
```
